# My Week 4 exercises

After rat-holing on JavaScript for most of last week, I have decided to resume working through _The
Odin Project_'s curriculum. Having read 4 of the 6 _You Don't Know JS_ series from _Kyle Simpson_, I
am explored JavaScript's mechanisms for:

* Objects
* Prototypical inheritance
* _this_ scoping
* Coercion
* Inbuilt types (Primitives and their natives)
* Grammar, the parser and you
* Closures
* Much, much more...

Anyway, onto the exerises for this week...
